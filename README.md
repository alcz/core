# harbour
Portable, xBase compatible programming language and environment

This is Harbour version 3.0.0bpo, a 3.0.0 with some fixes merged and also few backported bits according to my needs.
Usage not recommended, unless you have specific needs. For example, if target platform for your app is
some embedded device, low on memory and you don't need UTF8/Unicode support - it's lower footprint inspired this fork.
